# StormShield: Secure Software Development Life Cycle

## 1. Requirements and threat model

StormShield holds sensitive personal information (home and work locations, phone numbers, medical conditions, vulnerability status) and is used during emergencies, when availability and trust matter most.

| Threat | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account takeover | Attacker sees a person's home and medical details | bcrypt password hashing (cost 10), 8+ character passwords with letters and numbers, login rate limit (12/min/IP), generic login error |
| Session theft | Impersonation | HS256-signed JWT in an `httpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie, `Secure` on HTTPS, 7-day expiry, account existence re-checked every request |
| Privilege escalation | Resident sends city-wide alerts | Role read from the database on every request; all `/api/admin/*` routes call `requireAdmin()`; ticket status changes by residents limited to closing their own |
| Insecure direct object references | Reading or editing someone else's family list or tickets | Every family/ticket query is scoped to the session user ID |
| Fake panic flooding | Responders overwhelmed | Panic and check-in rate limits per IP; tickets deduplicated for check-in "need help" |
| SQL injection | Data loss or leakage | Parameterised queries everywhere; the only dynamic SQL fragments are built from server-side whitelists |
| XSS | Session or data theft | React escapes output; no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with user data; map popups render user text as React text nodes |
| Clickjacking / sniffing | UI redress | `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, strict referrer policy, geolocation-only permissions policy |
| Check-in link guessing | False "safe" status | 128-bit random tokens (`crypto.randomUUID`), format-validated, rate-limited |
| False reassurance | People stay in danger | If live data is unavailable the app shows "NO LIVE DATA", never "SAFE"; drills are labelled SIMULATED everywhere |

## 2. Privacy by design (POPIA)

- Explicit consent at registration, explaining exactly how locations and safety data are used.
- Data minimisation: medical and vulnerability fields are optional; GPS is shared only when the user chooses, and expires from risk calculations after 12 hours.
- Purpose limitation: medical and vulnerability details are only visible to admins (responders), never to family members.
- Right of access: "Download my data" on the profile page.
- Right to erasure: "Delete my account" (password-confirmed) cascades to locations, family circle, check-ins, tickets and messages; community reports are kept anonymously.
- Family members without accounts are only stored as name, relationship and phone, added by the user.

## 3. Secure design and implementation

- All input is validated and length-limited on the server (`lib/http.ts`), regardless of client validation. Phone numbers are normalised to E.164.
- Errors are mapped to safe messages; stack traces are only logged server-side.
- Secrets come from environment variables (`AUTH_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`); `.env` files are git-ignored and `.env.example` documents them.
- External calls (Open-Meteo, Nominatim) have timeouts, caching and failure back-off, so a slow provider cannot take the app down.
- Dependencies are pinned to exact versions; `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities at the time of submission.

## 4. Verification

- TypeScript strict mode, `next build` type checks.
- End-to-end API test script covering registration validation, duplicate accounts, login, panic, check-in, family links, reports, profile changes, admin-only access (403 for residents), wrong passwords (401), invalid tokens (404), ticket assignment, broadcasts and drill control.
- Browser tests of the registration wizard, dashboard and maps at desktop and mobile sizes.

## 5. Deployment and operations

- HTTPS-only hosting on Vercel; managed Postgres on Neon with encryption at rest.
- Rotate `AUTH_SECRET` to invalidate all sessions if a compromise is suspected.
- Next steps before production: shared rate limiter (e.g. Upstash Redis), audit log of admin actions, admin 2FA, verified SMS provider with delivery receipts, and penetration testing.
